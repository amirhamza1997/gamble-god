            </h1>
          <p className='pb-7'>
            The absolute fact is that most if not ALL sports gamblers lose money. The reason they lose is simple, it’s <br />
            not because they have bad luck, or because the game cheated, or any other non-sense excuse, it’s <br />
            because they don’t have <span className='bg-yellow text-dark-pink'>
              {'discipline '}
            </span> and most importantly, they have no idea how to  <span className='bg-yellow text-dark-pink'>
              {'manage their money. '}
            </span><br />
            This losing can easily be offset by following our <span className='bg-yellow text-dark-pink'>
              {'proven unit bet system. '}
            </span> Our unit bet system is the key to <br />
            success, but it also requires a <span className='bg-yellow text-dark-pink'>
              {'ton of discipline. '}
            </span> You cannot be too aggressive with your bets & you can
            <span className='bg-yellow text-dark-pink'>
              {'NEVER, '}
            </span> <br /> <span className='bg-yellow text-dark-pink'>
              {'NOT EVER'}
            </span> chase your losses. You must follow our plan & instructions 100% and play every
            game we release, <br /> exactly how we tell you to play it. If you do this, and stay disciplined, you will make <br />
            money and that is <span className='bg-yellow text-dark-pink'>
              {'100% money back guaranteed. '}
            </span> Remember, this is a marathon, not a sprint. You can’t<br />
            get rich quick betting sports; you must grind it out <span className='bg-yellow text-dark-pink'>
              {'to be successful. '}
            </span> <br /><br />

            Here at Gamble God, we rate every play with a unit value between 1 – 9. There are many factors that we <br />
            use to determine the bet unit.  <span className='bg-yellow text-dark-pink'>
              {'A 1-unit bet '}
            </span> is just as valuable as a 9-unit bet. It is imperative that you <br />
            don’t pick and choose which games to play. You must play EVERY game we release and bet it for the unit <br />
            amount we provide. For example, if we release 5-units on the cowboys -7 and at the sportsbook like <br />
            FanDuel or Caesars it’s at -110 and you are a $25 unit package player then you would bet $138 to win <br />
            $125 which is <span className='bg-yellow text-dark-pink'>
              {'5 units in profit. '}
            </span> Unit betting is the only way to minimize mistakes and to protect your <br />
            bankroll. <br /><br />

            <span className='bg-yellow text-dark-pink'>
              {'Sports betting is very similar to investing in the stock market, '}
            </span> meaning they both involve some level of <br />
            risk. The plays we release are based on proven information and could be compared to an investment
            opportunity <br /> that you receive from a stockbroker. The main difference is our returns are much higher <br />
            than that of a safe stock return, compounded with the fact that if our guidelines are followed the returns <br />
            far outweigh the risks involved. Stockbrokers don’t  <span className='bg-yellow text-dark-pink'>
              {'offer a refund '}
            </span> for bad advice, but Gamble God does. <br />
            If we have a losing week, then we refund the package price 100% with no questions asked. We know <br />
            through our experience that you must evaluate your <span className='bg-yellow text-dark-pink'>
              {'bankroll on a weekly basis, '}
            </span> not daily, and certainly <br />
            not per play, as we do not win every play we release. Over any given week we may have anywhere <br />
            between 25 - 40 plays across all sports and over a sample size of that many plays, we will show a profit. <br />
            So, with that said, you must commit to a minimum of 1 weeks’ worth of plays for our system to be <br />
            effective and successful.<span className='bg-yellow text-dark-pink'>
              {'effective and successful. '}
